Published by arrangement with Viking Penguin, a division of Penguin                                    Books USA Inc.                                        ONE                                          A few miles south of Soledad, the Salinas River drops in close to         the hillside bank and runs deep and green. The water is warm too,           for it has slipped twinkling over the yellow sands in the sunlight          before reaching the narrow pool. On one side of the river the golden        foothill slopes curve up to the strong and rocky Gabilan Mountains,         but on the valley side the water is lined with trees- willows fresh         and green with every spring, carrying in their lower leaf junctures         the debris of the winter's flooding; and sycamores with mottled,            white, recumbent limbs and branches that arch over the pool. On the         sandy bank under the trees the leaves lie deep and so crisp that a          lizard makes a great skittering if he runs among them. Rabbits come         out of the brush to sit on the sand in the evening, and the damp flats      are covered with the night tracks of 'coons, and with the spread            pads of dogs from the ranches, and with the split-wedge tracks of deer      that come to drink in the dark.                                               There is a path through the willows and among the sycamores, a            path beaten hard by boys coming down from the ranches to swim in the        deep pool, and beaten hard by tramps who come wearily down from the         highway in the evening to jungle-up near water. In front of the low         horizontal limb of a giant sycamore there is an ash pile made by            many fires; the limb is worn smooth by men who have sat on it.                Evening of a hot day started the little wind to moving among the          leaves. The shade climbed up the hills toward the top. On the sand          banks the rabbits sat as quietly as little gray sculptured stones. And      then from the direction of the state highway came the sound of              footsteps on crisp sycamore leaves. The rabbits hurried noiselessly         for cover. A stilted heron labored up into the air and pounded down         river. For a moment the place was lifeless, and then two men emerged        from the path and came into the opening by the green pool.                    They had walked in single file down the path, and even in the open        one stayed behind the other. Both were dressed in denim trousers and        in denim coats with brass buttons. Both wore black, shapeless hats and      
both carried tight blanket rolls slung over their shoulders. The first      man was small and quick, dark of face, with restless eyes and sharp,        strong features. Every part of him was defined: small, strong hands,        slender arms, a thin and bony nose. Behind him walked his opposite,         a huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes, and wide,             sloping shoulders; and he walked heavily, dragging his feet a               little, the way a bear drags his paws. His arms did not swing at his        sides, but hung loosely.                                                      The first man stopped short in the clearing, and the follower nearly      ran over him. He took off his hat and wiped the sweat-band with his         forefinger and snapped the moisture off. His huge companion dropped         his blankets and flung himself down and drank from the surface of         the green pool; drank with long gulps, snorting into the water like         a horse. The small man stepped nervously beside him.                          "Lennie!" he said sharply. "Lennie, for God' sakes don't drink so         much." Lennie continued to snort into the pool. The small man leaned        over and shook him by the shoulder. "Lennie. You gonna be sick like         you was last night."                                                          Lennie dipped his whole head under, hat and all, and then he sat          up on the bank and his hat dripped down on his blue coat and ran            down his back. "That's good," he said. "You drink some, George. You         take a good big drink." He smiled happily.                      George unslung his bindle and dropped it gently on the bank. "I           ain't sure it's good water," he said. "Looks kinda scummy."                   Lennie dabbled his big paw in the water and wiggled his fingers so        the water arose in little splashes; rings widened across the pool to        the other side and came back again. Lennie watched them go. "Look,          George. Look what I done."                                                    George knelt beside the pool and drank from his hand with quick           scoops. "Tastes all right," he admitted. "Don't really seem to be           running, though. You never oughta drink water when it ain't running,        Lennie," he said hopelessly. "You'd drink out of a gutter if you was        thirsty." He threw a scoop of water into his face and rubbed it             about with his hand, under his chin and around the back of his neck.        Then he replaced his hat, pushed himself back from the river, drew      up his knees and embraced them. Lennie, who had been watching,              imitated George exactly. He pushed himself back, drew up his knees,         embraced them, looked over to George to see whether he had it just          right. He pulled his hat down a little more over his eyes, the way          George's hat was.                                                             George stared morosely at the water. The rims of his eyes were red        with sun glare. He said angrily, "We could just as well of rode             clear to the ranch if that bastard bus driver knew what he was talkin'      about. 'Jes' a little stretch down the highway,' he says. 'Jes' a           little stretch.' God damn near four miles, that's what it was!              Didn't wanta stop at the ranch gate, that's what. Too God damn lazy to      pull up. Wonder he isn't too damn good to stop in Soledad at all.           Kicks us out and says 'Jes' a little stretch down the road.' I bet          it was  more than four miles. Damn hot day."                               Lennie looked timidly over to him. "George?"                                "Yeah, what ya want?"                                                       "Where we goin', George?"    The little man jerked down the brim of his hat and scowled over at        Lennie. "So you forgot that awready, did you? I gotta tell you              again, do I? Jesus Christ, you're a crazy bastard!"  "I forgot," Lennie said softly. "I tried not to forget. Honest to         God I did, George."
